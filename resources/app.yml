# Databricks App - Payment Approval Optimization Platform
# =============================================================================
# Deploys the app (FastAPI + React UI) to Databricks Apps. After bundle deploy,
# run the app via Workspace → Apps or: databricks bundle run payment_analysis_app -t dev
# App URL is shown in bundle summary or in Workspace → Apps.
# Name: payment-analysis. Source folder: bundle root (project root), see source_code_path below.
#
# Bound resources (include if required for the app):
#   - database: Lakebase (rules, experiments, incidents, ML features)
#   - sql_warehouse: analytics, app_config, gold views
#   - genie_space: when var.genie_space_id is set (create space first, then set variable)
#   - job (x12): Setup & Run, agents, streaming, Genie sync
#   - serving_endpoint (x4): when resources/model_serving.yml is included
#   - uc_securable (reports volume): app/jobs may read or write reports
#   - secret: optional; add scope/key below if the app needs secrets
# Not in bundle app.resources: dashboards (link by URL), MLflow experiment (used by job; add in UI if needed),
#   vector search index, UC function, UC connection (add in Apps UI if needed).
