# Mosaic AI Gateway – Governed LLM access for payment intelligence agents
# =============================================================================
# AI Gateway provides governance, rate limiting, usage tracking, and guardrails
# for generative AI models. See:
#   https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ai-gateway/
#   https://www.databricks.com/product/artificial-intelligence/ai-gateway
#
# Where AI Gateway is enabled in this solution:
#   • model_serving.yml: all four custom ML endpoints have ai_gateway config
#     (rate limits, usage tracking; risk_scoring has PII/safety guardrails).
#   • LLM agents (Payment Intelligence Assistant, Risk Assessment Advisor):
#     use your workspace’s Foundation Model APIs pay-per-token endpoint
#     (e.g. databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct). Enable AI Gateway on that
#     endpoint in the Serving UI (Serving → endpoint → Edit AI Gateway).
#
# To deploy an additional governed LLM endpoint via the bundle, uncomment the
# payment_llm_gateway block below and ensure your workspace has the chosen
# foundation model available. Otherwise, use the preconfigured pay-per-token
# endpoint and enable AI Gateway in the UI.
# =============================================================================

# Optional: add a dedicated LLM endpoint with AI Gateway by defining
# model_serving_endpoints here (e.g. payment_llm_gateway with a foundation
# model entity_name). Otherwise, enable AI Gateway on your workspace’s
# pay-per-token endpoint via Serving UI.
