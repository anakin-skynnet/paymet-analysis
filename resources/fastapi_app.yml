# Databricks App resource: name, source path, and resource bindings.
# Configuration: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/configuration
# Authorization: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/auth
# Runtime: app.yml at project root (command, env). source_code_path = workspace root (sync destination).
#
# Required for deployment:
#   - Resources below (sql-warehouse + jobs 1–7) are created by the bundle; deploy grants the app's service principal access.
#   - Environment: LAKEBASE_PROJECT_ID, LAKEBASE_BRANCH_ID, LAKEBASE_ENDPOINT_ID, DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID (see DEPLOYMENT.md).
#   - User authorization (OBO): user_api_scopes below request sql (and jobs/pipelines when available) so the app can run queries and Setup & Run jobs/pipelines on behalf of the user.
#
# Environment (Workspace → Apps → payment-analysis → Edit → Environment):
#   LAKEBASE_* — Required (match Job 1 create_lakebase_autoscaling). DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID — Required (from sql-warehouse binding).
#   DATABRICKS_HOST — Optional when opened from Compute → Apps. DATABRICKS_TOKEN — Optional when using OBO (token forwarded).
