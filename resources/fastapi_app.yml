# Databricks App resource: name, source path, and resource bindings.
# Configuration: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/configuration
# Authorization: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/auth
# Runtime: app.yml at project root (command, env). source_code_path = workspace root (sync destination).
#
# Environment (Workspace → Apps → payment-analysis → Edit → Environment):
#   PGAPPNAME               — Required. Match var.lakebase_instance_name (dev: payment-analysis-db-dev).
#   DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID — Required for SQL/analytics (from sql-warehouse binding).
#   DATABRICKS_HOST         — Optional when opened from Compute → Apps (workspace URL derived from request headers).
#   DATABRICKS_TOKEN        — Optional when using user authorization: open from Compute → Apps so token is forwarded (x-forwarded-access-token). Do not set DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID/SECRET when using forwarded user token.
