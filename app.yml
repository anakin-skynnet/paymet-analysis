# Databricks App execution (app.yaml). Required at project root.
# Docs: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/app-runtime
# App definition (resources, bindings): resources/fastapi_app.yml. When deployed, the platform runs this in source_code_path and proxies traffic to the app.
# Environment variables: defined below in env (not in Compute → Apps → Edit UI). Redeploy bundle to apply changes.
# User auth: open from Compute → Apps → payment-analysis so the platform forwards your token (x-forwarded-access-token).
# Lakebase: LAKEBASE_* below; DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_ID from sql-warehouse binding; DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID/SECRET injected by platform.
#
# WORKSPACE PORTABILITY: Dashboard and Genie IDs below are workspace-specific.
# On a new workspace, either:
#   (a) Leave dashboard IDs empty — the backend auto-discovers them from the workspace API, OR
#   (b) After running Job 4 (Deploy Dashboards), update the IDs below and redeploy.
# The Genie space ID must be set after creating the space in the target workspace.
