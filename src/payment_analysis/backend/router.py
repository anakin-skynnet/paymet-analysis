"""API router: config, auth, and feature routes.

All routes are under /api (required for Databricks Apps token-based auth).
Every route uses response_model and operation_id for OpenAPI client generation (apx/cookbook).
Auth and workspace URL use Databricks Apps headers (x-forwarded-access-token, X-Forwarded-Host).
See: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/http-headers
